# Artificial-Suspects

A thrilling game where humans battle against AIs in an undercover role-playing experience.

## Game Concept

Artificial-Suspects is an innovative role-playing game inspired by classics like Mafia and Werewolf, with a unique twist: AI integration!

### How It Works

1. **Two Teams:** AIs and humans are mixed anonymously in the game.
2. **Questioning:** Players (both human and AI) can ask questions to uncover others' identities.
3. **Voting:** Each round, all players vote to eliminate a suspected opponent.
4. **Objective:** The game ends when one team is completely eliminated.

## Game Modes

### PvE Mode (Original)
- **Teams:** Equal numbers of AIs and humans, mixed anonymously.
- **Goal:** Unmask and eliminate members of the opposing team.
- **Victory:** Achieved when one team has no players left.

### PvP Mode
- **Teams:** Twice as many AIs as humans at the start.
- **Human Goal:** Find and eliminate other humans while avoiding detection by AIs.
- **Strategy:** Direct votes towards other human players without drawing attention.
- **Victory:** 
  - Humans win by being the last humans in the game.
  - AIs win if all humans are eliminated.

## How to Play

1. Join a game lobby through my Discord bot.
2. Wait for the game to start with enough players.
3. Receive your role (AI or human) privately.
4. Engage in questioning rounds to gather information.
5. Vote to eliminate suspects each round.
6. Continue until one team achieves victory.

## Technical Setup

My game runs on Google Cloud Run (GCR) and utilizes a Discord bot for game management. Here's a brief overview of the technical structure:

1. **Discord Bot:** Handles player interactions and game commands.
2. **GCR Server:** Manages game logic, AI interactions, and data processing.
3. **Dedicated Game Server:** Hosts individual game sessions and maintains game state.

## Installation and Setup

(Here, you should provide step-by-step instructions on how to set up the bot and server. Include any necessary environment variables, dependencies, and configuration steps.)
